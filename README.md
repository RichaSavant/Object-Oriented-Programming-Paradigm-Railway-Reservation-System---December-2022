This project focuses on the development of a Railway Reservation System, designed to facilitate the booking process for passengers through an online platform. The use case documentation outlines the interactions between primary and secondary actors, including passengers, travel agents, administrators, and clerks. The system allows passengers to log in, view train schedules, select reservations, and make payments. Administrators manage the train schedules, seat bookings, and system updates, ensuring smooth operation and handling any errors. Clerks support the administration by updating train schedules and managing delays. The project also covers alternative flows, such as handling booking issues and providing refunds, and aims to ensure a seamless booking experience for passengers while maintaining system integrity and efficiency. Additionally, StarUML was used to model and design the use cases and system interactions, providing a clear and structured visual representation of the system's functionalities and actor relationships.
